This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Two players can take turns placing their markers (X or O) on a 3x3 grid, with the goal of getting three in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game also includes a reset button to restart the game at any time.

Features:
Two-player Mode: Players alternate turns between X and O.
Win Detection: Automatically detects and announces when a player wins or if the game ends in a draw.
Reset Functionality: Resets the game to its initial state for a new round.
Simple and Responsive UI: Clean design with responsive layout.

Technologies Used:
HTML: To structure the game board and interface.
CSS: For styling the game and enhancing the user experience.
JavaScript: To handle game logic, user interactions, and game state management.

Game Rules:
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Players take turns clicking on empty cells to place their marker (X or O).
The first player to get 3 of their markers in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game.
If all cells are filled and no player has 3 in a row, the game ends in a draw.
Use the "Reset" button to restart the game at any point.
